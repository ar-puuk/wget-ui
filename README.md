# Wget Command Generator: A Modern GUI for Advanced Web Retrieval

Effortlessly generate complex Wget commands for Windows and PowerShell with this intuitive and modern HTML tool. Designed for both novice and experienced users, this graphical user interface (GUI) simplifies the process of creating robust file download scripts, website mirrors, and spidering tasks. The tool provides access to a comprehensive set of Wget options, logically organized for ease of use. Additionally, it offers the unique capability to concatenate multiple commands and download them as a single, ready-to-run batch file.

The sleek and responsive interface, built with a modern Windows 11-inspired Fluent Design, ensures a user-friendly experience. Options are grouped into logical sections such as "General," "Recursive & Mirroring," "Network & Auth," "Advanced," and "Output," allowing users to quickly locate and configure the desired settings with integrated tooltips for guidance.

## How to Use the Wget GUI

The tool is straightforward to use:

* **Specify Target:** Begin by entering the target URL to download or specifying an input file containing a list of links.
* **Select Options:** Navigate through the various sections and select the desired Wget options using toggle switches for flags and text fields for parameters requiring values (such as recursion depth or authentication).
* **Generate Command:** As you select options, the corresponding Wget command is dynamically generated and displayed in real-time.
* **Add to Queue:** Once satisfied with a command, click the "Add Queue" button to save it to a list.
* **Combine and Download:** Repeat the process to add multiple commands. When ready, click the "Download .BAT" button to download a `.bat` file containing all the generated commands.

This tool eliminates the need to memorize Wget's extensive and case-sensitive syntax, reducing the risk of errors and saving valuable time.
